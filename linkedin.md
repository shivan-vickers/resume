## About

I'm a dedicated software engineering student with a diverse background that spans many different areas in the retail space especially in the marketing and sales of consumer electronics. I was led to the world of software development by a passion for problem solving, and a fascination and appreciation of technology. My extensive experience in diverse teams has taught me the value of collaboration and collective creativity. I think good software is built with good teamwork.

Beyond tech, I'm an avid musician who plays various instruments. I am bilingual and currently working to achieve fluency in a few more languages. I am passionate about visual art, fashion, and education. And of course, I'm curious about the ways in which all these worlds, and software, intersect.

I recently took a career break to make a meaningful impact in the community that my mother grew up in. I am community driven and hope to continue to make a positive impact through technology.

Thanks for taking the time to look at my profile.
